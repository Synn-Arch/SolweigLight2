# C5-61 Freeze manifest

Date: 2026-09-20. Frozen at commit `d2edbc105d5d3658d25613326439d3a3efb74bb9`
(branch `perf/claude-glm53-cpu-v5`, integration base `bfd9915e`, historical
checkpoint `14e88876`).

## Artifacts

- Batch/protocol definition: `benchmarks/protocols/claude_v5/final_protocol_v1.json`
- Wheel: `wheel/solweig_light-0.1.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl`
  sha256 `8fe69a5831cb340ce72ce911be9ccbd50c8808f6dcaaa8d4c69c6506a05b2ad4`
  (built with `uv build --wheel` from clean tree at the frozen commit)
- Isolated install: `site-packages/` (pip `--target`, `--no-deps`)
- Installed checks (both bitwise-PASS, 23/23 artifacts identical to the pristine
  `REFERENCE_bfd9915e_dense256.json`, import origin asserted inside the
  installed wheel, torch not imported):
  - `installed_check_dense256.json` — CPython 3.12.13 (`.venv`)
  - `installed_check_dense256_py311.json` — CPython 3.11.16 (`.venv-light`)
  The py3.11 result doubles as a cross-interpreter bitwise check: the pristine
  reference era and all campaign L2 gates ran under 3.12, and the 3.11 run
  reproduces every artifact byte-identically.

## Parity reference for L4

The existing v4 large-run outputs at
`reports/characterization/local_cpu_optimization_v1/qualification/final_combined_v1/large_harness/large_runs_v1/{dense1024,vegetation1024}/candidate_manifest.json`
are reused as the numerical reference (no new baseline, no missing-reference
capture). Integrity re-verified 2026-09-20: all 20 stored output files re-hashed,
all match recorded sha256. Provenance chain recorded in
`final_protocol_v1.json` (`parity_gate.reference_provenance`): v4 outputs
produced from source identical to `14e88876` (empty src/pyproject/tests diff to
`bfd9915e`); v5 tip proven bitwise-equal to `bfd9915e` at L2. Therefore the v5
final campaign must reproduce those sha256 values exactly on the same fixtures
and runtime options.

## Fixture copies

1024 fixture TIFFs copied into this worktree from the main-repo copies and
sha256-verified against the fixture manifests (dense1024 `51e5aac7…`,
vegetation1024 `6cc92180…`). TIFF binaries stay untracked (size); manifests and
met.txt are tracked.

## Environment

The final campaign (L4) executes under `.venv-light`
(`/Users/alansynn/Workspace/solweig-light/.venv-light`, CPython 3.11.16, numpy
2.4.6, numba 0.67.0, llvmlite 0.49.0, GDAL 3.13.0, macOS arm64 / Darwin
25.6.0) — the dependency-identical environment that produced the v4 large
reference. Under it the math profile reports the exact reference fingerprint
`8e4d38460b61b0299e7c1d525c8499750dcd219ef01cc785d7496dbe1dcbef30`
(`solweig-portable-sleef-5a1d179d-v1`); the assertion was made in-session
before the run, and its durable evidence is the fingerprint equality recorded
in both L4 `candidate_manifest.json` files (re-verified independently during
the C5-63 review). The campaign `.venv` (CPython 3.12.13) was used for
development gates and is recorded by the 3.12 installed check above. numba
njit cache enabled (per-run `NUMBA_CACHE_DIR` in the harness, matching the v4
protocol so cold-JIT time is comparable). Exact installed-check invocations
and interpreter versions: `FREEZE_CHECKS_ATTRIBUTION.json` (the check JSONs
use a schema that predates interpreter embedding, so attribution lives here).
