# Live dependency ledger — v6 continuation

Coordinator-maintained. Patch IDs immutable once landed; per-patch review status
tracked here. Branch `perf/claude-glm53-cpu-v5`; branch tip advances only by
integrator commits. Base of record for wave-1 workers: `5e1fab46`.

## Landed — C6-70 first-wave controlled integration (integrator commits on this branch)

| commit | task | content | gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 47cda54f | C6-70a | C6-10 recipe: service.py produces via numerical_geometry_recipe, shared identity/key; pipeline geometry_key + guarded_producer | adapted recipe/recipe-census/e2e/unit-geometry tests green |
| 717a7e72 | C6-70b | C6-42 W1 phase admission (api.py) + W3 GDAL_CACHEMAX (runtime.py); W2 deferred to C6-40 | phase-memory suite green (importers pinned api.py+runtime.py) |

| 5aa82325 | C6-70j | L2 chronology differential evidence (probe + logs + record) | L2 GREEN (below) |

L2 chronology differential (evidence/integration/L2_chronology_differential.md):
base 8e0b3877 vs integrated 78d242a6, 96x96 real-motif scene, 24 steps —
Lside 24/24 + Kside 14/14 events bitwise (inputs+outputs), all 11 final TIFFs
sha256-identical, cylinder-longwave equality transitive (Ldown in Lside inputs
+ bitwise Ldown/Tmrt TIFFs).
**C6-70 C6-60 review: APPROVE-WITH-CONDITIONS (independent GLM review; Opus
unavailable) — conditions closed by db5928fe** (F1 empty-jobs guard; F2
threads=2 whole-pipeline differential GREEN incl. wired GVF hooks; F3
accepted-residual record; see evidence/integration/C6-70_review_dispositions.md).
Reviewer recompute: 541 + 35 scoped tests green on the integrated tree.

## Queued (not dispatched)

| task | blocked by |
|---|---|
| C6-80 small cold/warm portfolio | **DONE** (evidence committed 2ce117e0) |
| C6-81 residual choice | **DONE + APPROVE** (selection 5928ead4; decoder declined 46450c75; independent GLM review APPROVE, Opus unavailable — evidence/reviews/C6-81_review_decoder_decline.md; F1 marker registration fixed at landing) |
| C6-90..94 conditional | **NOT SELECTED** (no measured activation case; see evidence/selection/C6-81_selection.md) |
| C6-99 final integration | **DONE** — surface confirmation (zero selected optionals; evidence/integration/C6-99_surface_confirmation.md) |
| C6-100 freeze | **DONE** — frozen at ea2eed53 (wheel gate PASS bitwise; true-TIFF/state gates pass on substance; raw-True admission-boundary case dispositioned in evidence/freeze/C6-100_integrator_dispositions.md) |
| C6-101 single campaign | **DONE as C6-101r (synthetic)** — user-authorized scope extension executed 2026-09-21: 16/16 campaign + 5/5 attribution slots OK, bitwise parity all tiles/runs (evidence/campaign_synthetic/, commit ea328078). Speedups (median, SYNTHETIC dev-tier): T4 cold 1.251× (sim 1.429×), T4 warm 1.059×, S1 cold 1.177×, S1 warm 1.075×. Attribution: visibility 27.0%, patch class ≈15% cum, GVF 15.6% |
| C6-81 reopened selection | **SELECTED + APPROVE-WITH-NOTES (C6-81r)** — R04+G06 patch-classification exact tables + CONDITIONAL cylinder-channel decode fix (must beat declined C6-50 evidence under same protocol); G05/R09/S01/S04/S05 not selected. Review: independent GLM, Opus unavailable; reviewer recomputed all shares from phase1_attribution.json (sum 99.99%); 5 non-blocking notes (evidence/reviews/C6-81r_review_selection.md). Implementation dispatched |
| C6-81r-impl R04+G06 | **LANDED** — worker v6-r04, integrated from verified worktree (src sha ee96fbc0 byte-matched). Gate `SOLWEIG_LIGHT_PATCH_CLASS_TABLES` strict '1', default OFF, wrapper routes untouched. Gates: combined 10-family 802/802 gate-OFF AND 802/802 gate-ARMED; dev parity bitwise 242-family + armed-neighbors 181; production lease (warm T4 4×1024², 6 interleaved runs): ON never slower in any pair, clean-pair ~1–2% end-to-end, all output digests identical OFF/ON and equal to campaign tile digests. Static review opus-alias GLM-5.3 APPROVE-WITH-NOTES (4 notes: masked sentinel gap, armed-matrix obligation kept, cache-identity across _sleef_classifier — re-run parity if that module changes, deferred compiled-artifact proof). Honest: selected ~15% residual hope → measured ~1–2% (dedup slice only; block-pass compute identical). Freeze ea2eed53 superseded by this reviewed commit; re-freeze wheel gate deferred to next release-candidate freeze (default path unchanged: gate OFF dispatch byte-identical) |
| C6-102 audit → C6-103 handover | C6-102 **DONE — CLEAN-WITH-NOTES** (independent GLM audit; Opus unavailable; evidence/final_review/C6-102_audit.md). C6-103 **DONE — APPROVE-WITH-NOTES** (independent GLM review; Opus unavailable; evidence/reviews/C6-103_review_handover.md; N1–N3 fixed at landing 6152864f-series). C6-103 record predates C6-101r; handover will be supplemented by the C6-101r campaign record |

| C6-104 branch rename+push | **DONE** — user-authorized 2026-09-21: branch renamed perf/claude-glm53-cpu-v5 → perf/cpu-optimization (tip unchanged 30624e02) and pushed to origin; old remote ref deleted; evidence/integration/BRANCH_RENAME.md |

Standing facts: routing = GLM via Z.ai, Opus unavailable (INVENTORY_C6-00.md).
24-tile target dataset still absent (synthetic 24-tile load = load test, not
actual-target claim). Exclusive benchmark lease starts at C6-80; wave-1 worker
timings are contended development-tier.

Integrator sign-off items for C6-70 (status after integration):
- RESOLVED by adoption: m7 §3 boundary stays as landed in C6-70b (W1
  in api.py with policy='reject'); width-2 sensitivity is inherited from
  the pre-existing availability-sensitive budget resolution and is now
  C6-40 phase-adapter territory.
- RESOLVED at C6-80: GDAL_CACHEMAX cap shows no per-worker cache
  regression at the timing tier (cap active in worker/phase children;
  integrated cold wins, warm wash — evidence/portfolio/README_C6-80.md).
- STANDING base fact (unchanged): wrapper cylinder-shortwave route is not
  bitwise vs serial reference at base; specialization gates bind to the
  wrapper route (C6-70e respects this; hook declines under fused).
- C6-42 m7 §3: corrected geometry reservation 4.4320 GiB means single-job
  budgets in ~[3.88, 4.83] GiB would NEWLY raise ResourceAdmissionError.
  Accept stricter boundary, or defer width-2 admission to C6-40 phase adapter.
- C6-42 m7: GDAL_CACHEMAX enforcement in _child_environment converts
  reservation into enforced cap — confirm no per-worker cache regression.
- C6-22 finding (NEW base fact): at 5e1fab46 the retained wrapper
  (production) cylinder-shortwave route is NOT bitwise vs the serial
  reference — float32-vs-float64 deg2rad geometry profile, max ~1.2e-4
  (KsideD 764/1120 px, Kside 703/1120 px on the real 32x35 packet),
  identical with the candidate module absent. Parity gates for any
  cylinder-route specialization must bind to the wrapper route; serial
  comparisons keep the original comparison_v1 budget. Corroborated by
  C6-21 (same pre-existing differential failure
  test_compiled_patch_parallel_diagnostics, order-dependent, fails
  identically without either module).
