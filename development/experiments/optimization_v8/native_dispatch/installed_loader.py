"""N8-21: trusted installed-artifact loader (BUILD_DESIGN.md section 8).

The AUTO/default entry point is `auto_load()`; the operator entry point is
`load_explicit()`.  Both funnel through `attempt_load()`, which resolves a
generation ONLY inside installed package resources and gates
content/ABI/ISA/profile BEFORE any dlopen:

1. Resolution: `importlib.resources.files(package)` -> `backends/
   native_generated/<generation>/`.  No environment variable is read on the
   auto path (`SOLWEIG_LIGHT_NATIVE_CACHE` is the expert dev path and is
   ignored here); the legacy developer cache `~/.cache/solweig-light` is
   positively rejected even if the package tree somehow resolves into it.
2. Path containment (review note N5 of the N8-30 review): lexical and
   realpath containment of the generation directory inside the installed
   package root, and of every manifest-declared member inside the
   generation directory -- absolute paths, `..` traversal and symlinked
   components escaping the tree are rejected BEFORE any member content is
   opened, hashed or mmap'd.
3. Content/ABI/ISA/profile gates, once per generation, in the
   BUILD_DESIGN 8.3 order: manifest schema + per-file sha256 + byte size +
   Mach-O structural walk + FMA re-audit (reused verbatim from the N8-20
   driver's `verify_generation`, never re-implemented here), then
   `abi.abi_version` / `wrapper_abi_layout_version` / exported-symbol
   surface against this loader's compiled expectations, then the math
   profile against the qualified allow-list, then host capability (arch,
   os / os_min_version, `cpu-feature:*` requirements via a sysctl probe --
   never `platform.machine()` alone) routed to the N8-10
   `UnsupportedNativeISA` taxonomy.
4. Decline semantics (SOURCE_FALLBACK.md table, implemented exactly):
   * ABSENT artifact / `source-no-native` manifest / unqualified host =>
     quiet auto decline (None, zero new stdout/stderr, no subprocess, no
     build attempt); an EXPLICIT request raises `MissingNativeArtifact`
     / `UnsupportedNativeISA` loudly.
   * PRESENT-BUT-CORRUPT artifact (schema/JSON invalid, name-derivation
     mismatch, hash/size/Mach-O/FMA-audit failure, path escape, ABI or
     math-profile outside the loader's speakable domain) => auto declines
     to Numba AND records the reason privately (`decline_reasons()`); an
     EXPLICIT request raises `CorruptNativeArtifact` naming the packaging
     defect.  Never a silent fallback, never a hidden rebuild: unverified
     bytes are never executed.
5. No runtime writes of any kind (HOME/temp/cache/site-packages), no
   subprocess, no network, no compile, and the default path never hashes
   the packaged `.ispc` source and never touches the legacy developer
   builder (`native_lw._cache_dir` / `_build_needed` / `_build`).

Reuse, not re-implementation: execution, locking and lifetime belong to
the reviewed N8-10 module.  `prepare_native_handle()` itself admits only
the legacy `build_stamp.json` layout and hashes the packaged kernel
source, so the installed path constructs `native_handle.NativeHandle`
directly after its own (stronger) manifest admission, reusing
`native_handle._load_entries` (reviewed ctypes prototype binding),
`native_handle._dir_lock` (publication serialization) and the shared
workflow-generation clock.  Both outcomes and failures are cached per
(pid, workflow generation, resolved root) exactly like the N8-10
registry/negative cache: a second load of the same generation performs
no re-hash, and a workflow does not retry a declined artifact every
block.
