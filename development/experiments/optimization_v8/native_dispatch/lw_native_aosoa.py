"""N8-13 native ctypes adapter for the direct AoSoA consumer (dossier 02).

`primary_aosoa()` is the AoSoA-domain twin of
``solweig_light.backends.native.lw_native.primary`` (:169-219): the SAME
C ABI (argtypes borrowed verbatim from ``lw_native._PROTO``, both exact
scalar specializations f32/f64 bound like ``lw_native._load``), the SAME
rejection set in the same order and the same ``UnsupportedInput`` class,
with exactly three sanctioned deltas required by the input-domain change:

1. sh/vs/vb are the producer's [G,P,W] payload passed as its float32 view
   (``block.view(np.float32)``; W=8, G=ceil(B/8), element
   ((g*P+p)*W+lane)) -- the N8-11 review note N6 binding convention for
   wave-2 consumers, and the same dtype lw_native.primary admits for its
   dense sh. The raw uint32 block is rejected with guidance (it would
   change a numba consumer's promotion; one bound dtype keeps B/C
   comparisons comparable). sun/shade are bool [G,P,W]. The row count B
   arrives as an explicit parameter (it is no longer derivable from the
   array shape) and is pinned to the gang count: G must equal ceil(B/8).
   Padding lanes are never validated numerically and never read by the
   kernel (tail-gang index redirection, see lw_primary_aosoa.ispc).
2. 0-d ndarray ``reflection_factor`` is PINNED, not narrowed (review note
   N7 of n8_30_review_n8_10_loader, carried from N8-04): the shipped
   numba path and ``lw_native._reflection_spec`` admit a 0-d float32
   ndarray computing as float32, so this adapter keeps the identical
   documented normalize (``float(x[()])``) and enforces it with positive
   AND negative tests in tests/optimization_v8/native/ BEFORE launch.
   Python float stays rejected (it would promote the reflection chain to
   float64 and change the typed graph).
3. A native failure AFTER launch raises ``NativeExecutionError`` and is
   never hidden: only ``UnsupportedInput`` is a pre-launch decline (the
   dispatcher-style fallback signal); everything else is loud.

Artifacts are loaded from an N8-20 generation directory (manifest.json
layout) -- the directory is fully content-verified through
``build_native.verify_generation`` (which re-runs the FMA audit on the
shipped assembly) before the CDLL is constructed. The default location is
the ``stage/`` directory next to this module; an explicit
``generation_dir=`` always wins. This is an experiment-scope adapter: it
is NOT wired into any dispatcher and enables no default.

Symbol names reuse the B7 C-ABI names (lw_primary_f32/lw_primary_f64) so
the scalar-specialization binding and manifest schema of the N8-20 driver
stay truthful; the AoSoA interpretation of the first five pointers is
carried by this adapter plus the kernel identity recorded in the
generation manifest (kernel name + sha256), never by symbol-table
conventions.
