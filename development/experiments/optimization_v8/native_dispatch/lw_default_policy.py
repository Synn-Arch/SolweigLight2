"""N8-22: disabled-by-default qualification policy selector for the
longwave-primary backend rows (dossier 06_default_dispatch.md).

This module PREPARES selection; it is not wired into ``src/`` and enables
nothing.  ``resolve_lw_backend()`` maps three inputs -- legacy env override,
installed-artifact state (the N8-21 ``LoadOutcome``), and qualification
records -- onto one of three rows:

* ``A``  legacy Numba dense kernels
  (``solweig_light.radiation.cylinder_longwave._longwave_primary`` /
  ``..._serial``) -- the shipped default and the FAIL-CLOSED target;
* ``B``  Numba AoSoA consumer
  (``solweig_light._native_dispatch.lw_b_control.lw_primary_b``);
* ``C``  native AoSoA consumer
  (``solweig_light._native_dispatch.lw_native_aosoa.primary_aosoa``).

THE LAW (packet gate): every non-legacy row ships DISABLED.  B/C activate
only on an explicit qualification record whose referenced evidence still
validates end-to-end at resolve time.  Absent, stale, malformed or
not-yet-qualified records -- and every error path in this module -- fail
CLOSED to row A, never to B/C.  The shipped registry
(``qualification_registry.json`` next to this module) is EMPTY: with it,
the auto path provably resolves to A today even when a fully qualified
native artifact is installed (dossier: "The repository must not ship
example rows with placeholder success").

DECISION ORDER (dossier 06 "Decision hierarchy", steps 1-2 and 5):

1. Legacy explicit override first, byte-compatibly with the live
   dispatcher ``cylinder_longwave._lw_kernel``: the value of
   ``SOLWEIG_LIGHT_LW_BACKEND`` is normalized exactly as there
   (``get(env, '').strip().lower()``).  ``native``/``ispc`` are the ONLY
   recognized expert values; any other NON-EMPTY string retains the
   historical silent-Numba behavior and NEVER becomes auto (DX_CONTRACT:
   "Unknown legacy strings retain historical Numba behavior rather than
   becoming auto by accident").  Unset/empty means auto.
2. Expert path (``native``/``ispc``): an explicit request is never
   downgraded to silent A.  It resolves through the N8-21 installed
   loader's explicit semantics: loaded artifact -> row C executes; any
   decline -> the selection carries the taxonomy error
   (``MissingNativeArtifact`` / ``CorruptNativeArtifact`` /
   ``UnsupportedNativeISA``) which the caller MUST raise (loud), exactly as
   ``installed_loader.load_explicit`` defines.  Qualification records are
   NOT consulted for an explicit request: expert forcing is deliberate
   user intent and overrides promotion policy (dossier step 1).
3. Auto path: records for row C are evaluated before row B (the promotion
   gates already require C to beat B1 in every qualified cell, so a
   qualified C dominates); within a row, records evaluate in registry
   order and the first fully valid one wins.

NO NEW DX: this module reads exactly one environment variable -- the
legacy public ``SOLWEIG_LIGHT_LW_BACKEND`` -- adds no env var, no output,
no file, and performs no IO at import (registry/artifact/evidence access
is lazy, bounded and quiet; declines are recorded only in the private
in-memory ``policy_reasons()`` log, never printed).  No network, no
subprocess, no writes, ever.

QUALIFICATION RECORD SCHEMA (``sw8-lw-default-row-record-v1``) -- the
authoritative shape N8-31/N8-32 transcribe measured results into and N8-40
wires; a pending, never-activatable template ships under ``templates/``::

Staleness taxonomy (all fail closed to A, reason prefixed accordingly):

malformed   schema/shape/type violations, escape-y evidence paths;
stale       an identity anchor no longer matches at resolve time -- the
            installed artifact generation/kernel/dylib differ (row C), the
            consumer module digest differs (row B), or a referenced
            evidence file is missing or its sha256 changed after
            certification;
unqualified-host  record host_class != current host (ordinary, quiet);
not-qualified     status != 'qualified', promotion gates no longer assess
            as passed, or review verdict is not an approval.
