"""Close-out order and lock lifetime of the prepared decode.

- A concurrent close() cannot invalidate an in-flight combined decode: it
  blocks on the owner lock until the native read completes (the kernel holds
  the GIL, so the close either lands entirely before the decode acquires the
  lock or entirely after it releases; both end states are asserted).
- A prepared handle keeps strong owner references, so dropping consumer
  variables cannot finalize a mapped owner mid-stage.
- Close-before-decode behavior matches the original path exactly.
