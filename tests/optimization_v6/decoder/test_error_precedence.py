"""L0/L1: error and close-out precedence is checkpoint-exact versus the base.

The accepted sequence discovers trouble in this order, per demanded channel
(shadow, vegetation, vegetation_building, diffuse):

    owner open checks (stable sorted-by-id owner order)
    -> per-leaf interval checks
    -> that channel's fresh decode streams' reserved codes (patch-major,
       pixel-inner)

so a reserved code in an EARLIER channel surfaces before a LATER channel's
open/range error. Every scenario here plants competing errors in different
checkpoints and asserts the prepared path raises the identical type and
message at the identical point (and returns bitwise-identical channels when
nothing is planted).
