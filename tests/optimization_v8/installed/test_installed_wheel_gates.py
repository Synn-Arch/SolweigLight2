"""N8-23 wheel/install gates: content, origins, collision/dependency bans.

The wheel under test is built from this worktree by ordinary pip in a fresh
venv (session fixtures in conftest.py) and installed, fully offline, into a
second fresh venv OUTSIDE the repo together with the pinned baseline runtime
closure.  Today this is the declared SOURCE/NO-NATIVE fallback wheel: the
native artifact arrives with N8-41, so every gate here is labelled fallback
and is explicitly NOT native qualification (DX_CONTRACT.md, last line).

These gates are origin-parametrized: the dx-surface capture runs through
``dx_snapshot.capture_runtime_surface_subprocess`` (the
``SOLWEIG_DX_PACKAGE_ORIGIN=subprocess:<python>`` mechanism), so N8-41/42
can rerun them unchanged against a native wheel's venv.
