"""N8-21 installed-artifact loader test bootstrap.

N8-41 vendoring: the loader and the N8-10 handle are imported from the
package; the N8-20 packaging driver stays the one experiments-dir sys.path
entry (it is not vendored). Provides
fake INSTALLED package trees in tmp: the staged proof generation is
copied into ``<tmp>/<pkg>/backends/native_generated/<gen>/`` so
resolution goes through the real importlib.resources machinery, never
through env vars.  The staged original is never mutated (session-end
integrity assert in the test module).

Skip labels (never fake-pass):
  [no-staged-artifact] -- the N8-20 proof generation is not present under
                          experiments/.../packaging/stage
